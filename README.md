# Tax Loss Harvesting / Rebalancing

This repo is provided purely for educational purposes. I'm not a financial professional and this tool does not represent financial advice. In fact, I'm positive that this tool should not be used to do any actual trades. The tool was implemented purely as an exploration of the topic of portfolio management. 

## TODO

- Cash field in portfolio seems to not completely work in rebalancing
- Not sure the direct indexing is actually exhaustive
  - maybe option to liquidate unallocated?
- Label Cash field in portfolio
- Switch options in trades:
  - Don't buy
  - Don't sell
  - Remove liquidate (it just doesn't make sense, you can do it on your own)
- Does the generate button do anything?
- Weight slider should be renamed

- Add flex query api
- Add client portal api
